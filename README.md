# Scrape
Using Axios to scrape website for data and cheerio to store it.


I built a site that uses Axios web scraping tools to pull all of the articles from site "www.echoJS.com" that have a h2 size heading. More importantly I implemented a Mongo database on the backend to store articles that you can click on and you can attach a note to it as well. 

To Run simply download
run "npm install"
then run "mongo" in your terminal to start your mongo server
&  Finally  "Node server.js"
